            <h2>Online Fruit Shop</h2>
            <p>
                In January 2022, I started learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> as a beginnner. However, my trainer did not really focus on teaching me the syntax of the languages but rather, focused more on teaching me how to copy and paste written code. As a result, I was only able to make and deploy the following websites:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://dulcet-semolina-69fe5a.netlify.app/">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="" alt="First Website" title="My very first website">
                            <figcaption>Website1 version 1.0</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://dynamic-tanuki-0b7689.netlify.app/">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="" alt="First Website_revised" title="My very first website_revised">
                            <figcaption>Website1 version 1.1</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, the websites are not functional.</p>

            <h2>Little Taco Shop</h2>
            <p>
                Number 2 in this list of websites is <a href="https://willylaisa.github.io/Learning-CSS/">The Little Taco Shop</a>. After joining DirectEd Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp, my desire to continue learning web development was stirred. So far, the experience in the boot camp has been amazing. We have learnt a great deal about web development, among other soft skills that are required in the field of IT and are yet to learn even more in the days to come.

            <h2>Acme</h2>
            <p>
                The third project in this list and the best so far was the <a href="https://willylaisa.github.io/Learning-Tailwind/">Acme Rockets website</a>. As interesting as the website may look, the process of making it was definitely not a walk in the park. It took days of running into errors and trying all kinds of things especially since we were being taught how to use an emerging language called tailwindcss which makes front end web development much easier. However, once finished, I felt very proud of myself and could not for one moment hide my joy and satisfaction.
